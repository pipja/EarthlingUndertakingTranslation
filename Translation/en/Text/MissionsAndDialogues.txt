<color\=#B21717>（惊醒）</color>师傅！！=<color\=#B21717>(Wakes up)</color> <size\=30>Master!!</size>
什……什么？！我这是，刚才我不是正在入定中吗？我睡着了？=What ... what?! I was, wasn't I just in the middle of meditation? Did I fall asleep?
（你从睡梦中悠悠醒转过来，右手下意识抚上了案上的古玉，这是你师傅的遗物，上面布满古朴的花纹和淡淡的“红印”。）=<size\=20>(Waking up from your sleep, your right hand subconsciously touched the Ancient Jade on the nightstand. The only thing your Master left behind, adorned with simple designs and a faint "<color\=#B21717>Red Seal</color>")</size>
原来只是梦吗……哎，师傅，您老人家究竟去哪了……我这些年可是有好好遵从您的嘱托，隐世修炼，不沾凡尘因果……=<size\=20>So it was only a dream? ... Hey, Master, Old man, where'd you go ... I have followed your instructions to the best of my abilities over the years, cultivating in seclusion, having no involvement with mortal affairs...</size>
但这么多年修为始终原地踏步……为何会如此，难道我……理解错了您所说的「出世之道」……=<size\=20>But why is it even after so many years my cultivation still hasn't made any headway ... I just don't understand, did I ... fail to grasp what you meant about "<color\=#FFFFFF>Withdrawing from the World</color>" ...</size>
<color\=#B21717>（摇头）</color>罢了，多想无益。=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Shakes head)</color></size>It's useless to think more about it.

师、掌门师尊，不好啦……=<size\=20>Master</size>, <size\=20>Master</size>, Master, there is bad news...
何事如此慌张？！=Why are you flustered?!
山门外来了一个满嘴胡话的疯老头想要见掌门师尊，怎么赶都赶不走……=Outside the main gate, there's a Crazy Old Man who wants to see you Master. Nothing we did would get him to leave...
清风师兄上前驱赶，可此人身法诡异无比，每次都只能堪堪摸到对方的衣角……还，还狠狠地摔了一跤。=<size\=18>Senior Brother Qingfeng stepped forward to turn him away, but the old man made some strange hand gestures and Senior Brother couldn't even touch the hem of his sleeves before he tumbled down to the ground ....</size>
竟有此事？且让出去会会他。=How could this happened? Let's go out and meet him.
疯老头=Crazy Old Man

前辈认得这玉佩？！=Senior recognizes this Jade pendant?
<color\=#B21717>（大笑）</color>离开……寻找……你我都不过是棋子罢了！哈哈哈哈……=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Laughing loudly)</color></size>Leave ... Seek ... You and I are but  chess pieces!\n<size\=30>Hahahaha...</size>
（疯老头在嬉笑之间化作一缕青烟消失不见，一张泛黄的纸飘入你的手中……）=(The Crazy Old Man disappears into a wisp of smoke between laughs, a yellow paper floats into your hands ...)
<color\=#B21717>（惊讶）</color>好高深的遁法……咦？这纸上所绘的图案似乎在哪里见过。=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Amazed)</color></size>What a profound movement technique ... eh?\nThe pattern drawn on this paper, I seem to have seen it before.
此人虽行事疯癫、言辞不清，但他似乎认得师傅的玉佩？且他所说的「天星叩门」也令人在意……=<size\=20>Although the man acted crazy, and his words were unclear, he seemed to recognize Master's Jade pendant? And what he said "<color\=#FFFFFF>The heavenly star knocking at the door</color>" is also interesting ...</size>
那是在云梦大地上从未见过的星夜奇象，而且它就发生在昨天夜里，这真是吉凶难测啊……=That supposedly never before seen phenomenon occured in the <color\=#9F2B68>Yunmeng</color> region, and it happened just last night, is this a good or bad sign? ah ...
唔，看来有必要下山去寻找一下线索，先去南边的柴桑村看看吧。=Well, it seems necessary to go down the mountain to look for clues; First i'll head, to the south, the village of <color\=#088F8F>Chaisang</color> should be worth inspecting.

<color\=#B21717>（双眼赤红）</color>你……你，你给我记住了！=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Eyes Red)</color></size>You ... you, I will remember you!
瑶姬=Ji Yao
我乃瑶姬，刚才谢过道友出手解围，我们有缘再见吧。=I am Yao Ji, i must thank you for helping me out of that predicament, if the fates our kind let us meet again.
女子微微行礼然后化作一道虹光飞向了天边。=The woman gives you a slight bow then turned into a rainbow colored light and flew into the sky.
这个女子倒是面生得很，这个装束在云梦并不常见呢……不过现在还是处理正事要紧。=The woman seems familiar, but her attire is not common around Yunmeng ... still it's better to take care of previous business first.
##Relation goes Up with Ji Yao

####Both Routes

「天星叩门」的线索（任务）=The clues on "The Star of Heaven Knocks" (Mission)
这位道友有礼了，我想跟你打听一下有关「天星叩门」的消息……=My respects fellow daoist, I wish to inquire any information regarding "The Star of Heaven Knocks" ...

嘿嘿，实不相瞒，我确实知道一些消息，只不过嘛，这消息我来之不易……=Hehe, I'm not going to lie, I do know some information, but well, this information was not easy to come by ...
我曾听闻此地东北方的九嶷山谷有一只长牙孽畜叫“金睛兽”，此獠一身都是宝，尤其是它的精血可入药炼丹，乃修炼至宝……=<size\=18>I have heard that there is a long-tusked creature called "Golden-Eyed Beast" in "Jiuyi Valley" located to the northeast of this place, this beast is priceless, especially its blood which can be used to make medicine, which are important for those cultivating ...</size>
如果你能为我寻来金睛兽精血，我就告诉你如何？=If you can acquire the Golden-Eyed Beast blood for me, I will tell you what i know, how about it?

我可不想白白葬送性命！（离开）=I don't want to die in vain! (Leave)

假如以你现在的实力就贸然前去找寻，怕是只会变成那金睛兽的盘中餐。=Looking at your current strength if you decided to act rashly, I'm afraid you'll only become the Golden-Eyed Beast's next meal.
（他说得不错，此事得从长计议，我不妨先招收弟子、提升实力，做好万全准备再前往。）=(He's right, this matter has to be considered carefully, I might as well recruit disciples, improve my strength and take all necessary precautions before setting out.)
（正好最近有求道者来我派寻求仙缘，先回门派看一看求道者名单上有没有好苗子。）=<size\=20>(It just so happens that recently there are supplicants coming to our sect seeking their destiny, lets first head back to the sect to see if there are any good saplings on the list of petitioners.)</size>
###Leave Route
好吧，等你想做了再来找我吧，不过没有金睛兽精血我是不会说那个消息的。=Fine, come back to me when you've thought it over, but I won't give you any information without the Golden-Eyed Beast Blood.

我知道您此时一定理不清头绪，请您听我说……=I know you must be confused at this moment, please let me explain ...

自上次被您惩戒教训后，我想起了叔叔对我的教诲，惭愧不已！我想明白了，我缺少的正是像您这样正直的严师！=Since I was disciplined by you, I remembered what my uncle had taught me and was ashamed! I figured out that what I lacked was a stern and upright teacher like you!
我愿收你为徒（收为徒弟）=I will take you in as a disciple (Take as Disciple)
你与我无缘（驱赶离开）=You have no business with me (Drive Away)
####Take as Disciple Route
好，知错能改，善莫大焉，以后你就是我门中人了。=Very well, knowing your mistakes and wishing to correct them, is praiseworthy, from now on you will be one of us.

##A battle
呼，这孽畜当真凶狠。=Phew, this monster was really vicious.
刚才那人已不见踪影了，本想解释一番，看来是缘分未到，此行目的也已经达到，先回去找黄木道友吧。=<size\=20>By now that person has long since fled, I wanted to explain, but it seems that was not our fate, the purpose of this trip has been completed, lets first head back to find Daoist Mu Huang.</size>

门中大堂上横七竖八地躺着几具“尸体”，一男子从你身旁路过匆匆离去……=A few "corpses" lying around in the lobby in the door, a man passed by you and left in a hurry ......
孙神医……=Dr. Sun Shenhua ......
唉！济苍观今日不便接客，小友还是请回吧……=I'm sorry! Ji Cang Guan is not available today, you should go back ......
恕晚辈无礼，刚才前辈与孙神医的话我都听到了，我本有一事欲询问道掌门，但眼下……=Forgive the rudeness of the late generation, just now I heard the words of seniors and Sun divine doctor, I originally had a matter to ask the Road Master, but at the moment ......
此事症结应该就在于那处洞府，我愿前往一趟为前辈分忧。=The crux of the matter should lie in that cave, I would like to go to a trip to share the worries of the seniors.
当真？我要留守此地看护徒弟，正好抽不开身，小友愿意出手那可真是太好了！那洞府就在此地东北方向的不远处。=Are you sure? I have to stay here to watch over my disciple, and I can't get away, so it's great that you are willing to help! The cave is just a short distance to the northeast of here.
如若小友真的能将我徒弟们的魂魄找回，我当知无不言、言无不尽。=If you can really retrieve the souls of my disciples, I will say everything I can.
前辈，原来那洞府主人就是曾经的云梦魔头白仙人，想必道掌门的徒弟就是中了他的邪术。=Senior, it turns out that the owner of that cave is the former cloud dream devil, the White Immortal, and I think that the disciple of the Daoist Master was caught in his evil spell.
咦？这是？=Huh? This is?
我于洞府深处发现了这本邪异黑书，既是白仙人的传承，想必这里面有破解之法！=I found this evil black book in the depths of the cave, since it is the inheritance of the White Immortal, I think there must be a way to break it!
小友可真是帮了大忙呀！对了，之前听闻小友说遇到了一些困惑，不知为何事？=You've been a great help! By the way, I heard that you have encountered some confusion, I wonder what it is?
晚辈为「天星叩门」一事而来，久闻前辈见多识广，还请前辈不啬赐教。=The late generation for the "heavenly star knocking on the door" matter to come, long heard of the senior knowledge, please do not hesitate to give advice.
眼前的男子突然沉思起来，在屋内来回踱步，最终开口——=The man in front of him suddenly pondered, paced back and forth in the room, and finally spoke -
「天星叩门」乃云梦千年一次的奇异天象，但它预示着什么，并无文字记载……=The "Star of Heaven knocking at the door" is a strange celestial phenomenon that happens once in a thousand years in Yunmeng, but there is no written record of what it foretells ......
竟如此神秘……不过它竟是千年一次？既然是按照一种规律在运行，其中想必有什么深意。=It is so mysterious ...... but it is even once in a thousand years? Since it is running according to a law, there must be some deep meaning in it.
我也未曾参透它的玄机，不过云梦之地故老传说……=I also have not penetrated its mystery, but the land of cloud dreams old legends ......
几万年前，这片大地上曾迎来末法时代，灵炁枯竭、五行颠倒……=Tens of thousands of years ago, this land had ushered in the end of the era, the spiritual air depletion, the five elements reversed ......
……冰冷死寂的严寒肆虐在天地之间，万物在永夜中迎来了死亡的终结。=...... cold, deadly cold rages between heaven and earth, and all things usher in the end of death in the eternal night.
而据说在末法时代降临前，有人曾见过「天星叩门」在夜空中闪烁。=And it is said that before the advent of the End Times, some people have seen the "heavenly star knocking at the door" shining in the night sky.
呵呵，也许只是一个故事，毕竟谁也没有真正见过末法时代。=Oh, maybe it's just a story, after all, no one has really seen the end times.
（那疯老头所言……实在令人在意。他遗留的那张地图或许隐藏着一些秘密，不探寻一番的话实在难以心安。）=(What that crazy old man said ...... is really concerning. He left behind that map may hide some secrets, not to explore some words really hard to peace of mind.)
（为了避免遇到未知的凶险，先去云梦西边的阳谷村、无空山历练一番吧。）=(In order to avoid encountering unknown dangers, go to Yanggu Village and Wukong Mountain in the west of Yunmeng for some experience first.)
此番谈话收获颇丰，多谢前辈解惑，晚辈告辞。=This conversation has been very fruitful, thanks to the senior to solve the confusion, the late generation farewell.
也好，疑惑既答，我也不留小友了。这是我的一点心意，望请小友不要推辞。=Good, doubts are answered, and I will not keep you. This is a small token of my appreciation, I hope you will not resist.
小友可找到解决方法了？=Have you found a solution?
山神堵路=Mountain Gods Blocking the Road
无法交流，我且暂时告退吧（离开）=I can't communicate, so I'll leave for now (leave)
道路……通畅了。=The road ...... is open.
招摇山火光=Firelight in the waving mountains
咕？=Goo?
诛杀姑获鸟=Kill the goblins
姑获鸟=Gooch
我……看不到那个光景了。=I ...... can't see that light anymore.
不错，地图上显示的正是此处，且进去一探吧。=Yes, the map shows exactly here, and go in and explore.
无法，救赎。=Impossible, redemption.
杀了它，杀了它，杀了它。=Kill it, kill it, kill it.
是你？不，应该不是你……=Is it you? No, it shouldn't be you ......
你杀了祂，如果是以前，我会要你偿命，不过现在…我反而应该感谢你。=You killed Him, if it was before, I would have asked you to pay for your life, but now...I should thank you instead.
这是你应得的。=This is what you deserve.
你的眼中……有渴望，还有纠结。我见过许多与你相仿的人族，他们最喜欢的就是作茧自缚、画地为牢……呵呵。=There is longing in your eyes ...... and entanglement. I have met many human beings similar to you, and their favorite thing is to make a cocoon and draw a prison ...... huh.
在北方，有一场大战不可避免，而南方在那之后也不会平静……=In the North, there is a great war inevitable, and the South will not be calm after that ......
如果你决定好了，来南边的青丘，待到时机来临，我赠你一份机缘。=If you decide, come to the south of the Green Hill, when the time comes, I gift you a chance.
这般修为，简直是恐怖如斯！疯老头引我来此，就是为这个人？不对，他称呼我为「人族」，难道……=This kind of cultivation is simply terrifying! The crazy old man lured me here for this person? No, he called me "human", could it be that ......
不过这里什么也没有啊，除了这一只巨大的树妖……=But there is nothing here ah, except this one huge tree demon ......
什，什么？！这……=Wha, what?! This ......
巨大的、树妖的躯壳突然绽放出一团耀眼的光芒，不断有流光聚集到玉佩上，血迹与流光交融合为一滴金色液体——=The huge, tree demon's carapace suddenly blossomed into a dazzling glow, and streams of light kept gathering on the jade pendant, and the blood and streams of light intermingled into a drop of golden liquid -
唔，一时半会无法看出门道，先回门派再细细研究吧=Well, a moment can not see the doorway, first back to the sect and then study it in detail
激活圣树=Activating the Sacred Tree
这……这是？=This ...... is?
触摸圣树=Touching the Sacred Tree
（你感觉胸口一阵灼热，金色液滴从你怀中飞出，转眼便没入眼前的巨树之中，随后光芒大盛——=(You feel a burning in your chest as golden droplets fly out of your arms and into the giant tree in front of you, followed by a great glow -
这颗巨树在立派初期就已经存在，我一直以为它只是普通的树木……看来如今已有了什么新的变化……=This giant tree has existed at the beginning of the establishment of the faction, I always thought it was just an ordinary tree ...... seems to have any new changes now ......
正当你欲上前详细端详古树之时，一个慌张的声音传来，让你停下了脚步——=Just when you want to go up and examine the ancient tree in detail, a panicked voice comes and stops you in your tracks -
谷老=Gu Lao
快快请起，你是阳谷村村长谷老吧？发生何事了？=Please rise quickly. You are the village head of Yanggu Village, Elder Gu, right? What's going on?
我、我们……哎，老朽不知啊，还是请上仙到我们村一趟吧。=I, we ...... hey, I do not know ah, or please the upper fairy to our village a trip to it.
大家伙都，都全身冰冷、僵硬不动，对外界毫无反应。就，就像死去了一般，可身上仍有脉搏跳动……=The big guys are, all body cold, stiff and immobile, no response to the outside world. Just, just like dead, but there is still a pulse beating in the body ......
我卜出的卦象显示分明在这附近，怪哉。=I divined the trigram shows clearly in this neighborhood, strange.
不知姑娘因何事烦扰。=I don't know what's bothering you.
呵呵……无妨，举手之劳=Oh ...... no harm, a handful of work
我正在寻找一样东西，一颗黑色的珠子，此物干系重大，我有不得不得到它的理由。=I am looking for the same thing, a black bead, this thing is important, I have to get it for a reason.
如果道友愿意助我一臂之力，我必有答谢。=If you are willing to help me, I will have a thank you.
乐意至极（接受任务）=Happy to be there (accept the assignment)
如此甚好！我听说柴桑村附近曾有人目睹持有此珠的人……=That's good! I've heard that someone near the village of Chaisang once witnessed the person holding this bead ......
唔……如此，我会帮道友留意的。=Well ...... so, I will help you keep an eye on it.
不知道、不清楚、没见过。（离开）=Don't know, not sure, haven't seen it. (leave)
道友请看，不知这是否是你所需之物。=Fellow Daoist, please take a look, I don't know if this is what you need.
通体幽黑，灵力内敛，很像……=The body is dark and the spiritual power is internalized, much like ......
谢过道友，这是我的一点心意，神农氏族从不欠别人人情。=Thank you, fellow Daoist. This is a small token of my appreciation. The Shen Nong Clan never owes anyone a favor.
解救商人=Rescuing businessmen
行脚商阿王=Traveler Wang
有妖兽！=There are demonic beasts!
不要惊慌，到我身后来！=Don't panic, come behind me!
刚才我进去妖兽巢穴中探险，没想到差点把小命交待在那了。=Just now I went into the demon beast nest to explore, I did not expect to almost give up my life in there.
这种巢穴虽然会有不少宝贝，但也十分凶险。=This kind of nest will have a lot of treasures, but it is also very dangerous.
刚才多谢阁下相救，这是我前些天捡……是我的藏品！还请不要推辞。=Thank you for saving me just now, this is my collection I picked up ...... a few days ago! Please don't push back yet.
这位道友很面生啊，我似乎从没见过你。=This daoist friend is very familiar, I seem to have never seen you before.
嘿嘿嘿，美人儿，你这招对我可没用，道爷我见过的女人没有一万也有八千，我想要的是……嘿嘿。=Hey, hey, hey, beauty, you this trick to me can not be used, the Tao master I have seen the woman not 10,000 also have 8,000, I want to ...... hehehe.
你刚才撞我一下，我的法宝就到你身上了，就你腰间佩戴这铃儿！嘿！现在是人赃俱获！！=You just hit me, my magic treasure to your body, on your waist wearing this bell! Hey! Now it's all stolen goods!
这群贼人，我在旁边看得真真切切，就是想杀人夺宝。=This group of thieves, I can see really well on the side, is trying to kill people to take the treasure.
给我住手！（进入战斗）=Stop it! (entering the fight)
呜啊，可恶，你到底是谁？你有什么图谋？=Oooh, damn it, who the hell are you? What's your plan?
我只是看不惯你的行事！=I just can't stand the way you act!
这铃儿呀，姐姐我可以给你，就看你能不能接住它了……=This bell ah, sister I can give you, depending on whether you can catch it ......
嘿嘿，道友果然识相……=Hey hey, you really know what you're doing ......
男子即将触碰到铃铛的瞬间，铃铛忽然倒转一圈发出一道劲气，男子的五根手指齐齐被劲气切断——=The moment the man was about to touch the bell, the bell suddenly reversed a circle to send a strong qi, the man's five fingers were cut off by the strong qi -
咦？你怎么不把它接住呀？哎呀~都说男人就是对已经到手的东西不稀罕呢~=Huh? Why don't you catch it? They say men don't care about what's in their hands.
你突然觉得面对着不是一个女子，而是一只噬人的毒蝎。=You suddenly feel that you are not facing a woman, but a devouring scorpion.
出了云梦，记得多来九黎找姐姐哦。=Out of the cloud dream, remember to come more to Jiu Li to find sister Oh.
空气中只留下一连串银铃般的轻笑声，那名穿着奇特服饰的银发女子早已消失不见——=The only sound left in the air was a series of silver bell-like soft laughter, the silver-haired woman in a peculiar costume had long since disappeared -
你可知道黑水潭在何处？=Do you know where the Blackwater Pool is?
黑水潭？=Blackwater Pool?
我记得是在云梦的东北方向……=I remember it is in the northeast of Yunmeng ......
经打听过，并不在那个方向。=I've asked around before and it wasn't in that direction.
也许问你是个错误。=Maybe it was a mistake to ask you.
好像是这样的……不错……这是你应得的。=It seems like it ...... is good ...... it's what you deserve.
上，上仙！上仙来了，上仙来了！我们有救了。=Up, up the fairy! The upper fairy is coming, the upper fairy is coming! We are saved.
村中横七竖八放着几个表情呆滞的“人”，一须发皆白的老者叫住了你——=There are several "people" with dull expressions in the village, and an old man with white hair calls out to you...
不知咋地，从前几日开始，就有好多村民变成了这样！怎么叫唤都无反应，哎哟，愁煞老朽也！=Somehow, since the last few days, there are many villagers have become like this! How to call no response, ouch, worried about the old man also!
而且过路的修士都说此事风险太大，没有一个愿意帮助我们，哎！=And the passing monks all said this matter is too risky, none of them are willing to help us, hey!
我果然来迟了一步！=I'm really late to the party!
道友知道此事中的蹊跷？=Do you know what is strange in this matter?
其实我乃神农氏之女瑶姬，来此地是为了阻止一件邪物出世……=In fact, I am the daughter of Shennong's Yao Ji, came here to stop an evil thing out of the world ......
那件邪物里封印着「混沌凶兽」的魂魄，一旦放出后果将不堪设想。=The soul of the Chaos Beast is sealed in that evil object, and once it is released, the consequences will be unthinkable.
我本来顺着线索寻找，却不料搜集到多枚难以辨认的黑珠，它们都是假的！=I had followed the clues to find, but unexpectedly collected multiple illegible black beads, and they were all fake!
如今看来背后定是有操控之人，而且此人正在收集凡人魂魄来喂养「混沌」。=Now it seems that there must be someone behind it, and this person is collecting mortal souls to feed Chaos.
可眼下我们面临一个问题，这个人究竟藏身何处……=But right now we are faced with the question of where this person is hiding ......
啊？！那该如何是好？还请上仙出手相助我等啊！=Ah? What should we do then? Please help us!
此事就交给我吧。（接受任务）=Leave this matter to me. (Accept the assignment)
上仙慈悲！=The Lord has mercy!
众人谈话间，一仙风道骨的修士飘然而至——=While the people were talking, an immortal Taoist monk floated in -
看来诸位有烦忧之事。=It seems that you all have something to worry about.
道掌门？你怎会在此？=Taoist Master? What are you doing here?
我也是刚到，诸位刚才所言，我恰好皆听入耳中。=I also just arrived, and I happened to hear what you all just said.
贫道正是为此事而来，悬济苍生乃我辈中事，济苍观怎么置身事外。=The poor Taoist is exactly for this matter and came, hanging Ji Cang life is my generation in the matter, Ji Cang Guan how to stay out of the matter.
可你也听到，我们的线索完全中断，要寻找一个身份不明神秘人，无异于大海捞针。=But you also heard, our clues completely interrupted, to find an unknown mystery person, it is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
呵呵！如果我没有猜错，此人一定会去摇光林深处的「混沌地宫」，那是古籍记载的封印「混沌凶兽」之地！=Oh! If I'm not wrong, this person will definitely go to the "Chaos Palace" in the depths of the Shaking Light Forest, which is the place where the "Chaos Beast" is sealed according to the ancient records!
我们不妨在那里守株待兔！=We might as well be there on guard!
「混沌地宫」？那不就是在摇光林入口的东北深处？太好了！我们赶紧动身吧！="Chaos Palace"? Isn't that deep in the northeast of the entrance to the Shaking Light Forest? Great! Let's get moving!
瑶姬道友莫急——=Yogi Daoist friends do not hurry -
瑶姬在匆忙之间皆化作流光向天边飞去=Yaoji in a hurry are turned into a stream of light to the sky
小友且慢，我有一个不情之请。=Little friend wait, I have an unpleasant request.
这些村民的肉身就这么放在此处，如果被一些毒虫毒物噬咬就麻烦了。=The flesh of these villagers just put here, if some poisonous insects and poisonous things bite will be in trouble.
我这有一法子，烦请小友找来3株火纹草，交于谷老，让他在此处摆放加以守护。=I have a method here, please find 3 fire grass, handed to the old man, let him place here to guard.
如此也好，还是道掌门想得周到。=So good, or the Taoist master thoughtful.
此事凶险，我不能轻身涉险。（离开）=This is a dangerous matter, I can not lightly involved in the risk. (Leave)
恳请上仙发慈悲之心……=I implore the Lord to send a compassionate heart ......
这，这是火纹草？太好了！老朽这就按照道仙人的指示在此守护。=This, this is fireweed? Great! I will guard it here as instructed by Immortal Dao.
哎哟，真是不知道该如何感谢上仙，你就是我们的救命恩人啊！=Aigoo, really do not know how to thank the upper fairy, you are our life-saving benefactor ah!
言重了，道掌门古道热肠，他这样的人才是云梦的中流砥柱。=The words are heavy, the ancient way of the Taoist master, he is such a person is the mainstay of the cloud dream.
不过老朽还是要感谢您和瑶姬仙子，之前就已经有好几个村子遭殃了，因为没有上仙出手帮忙，那些人都已经离世。=However, I still want to thank you and Fairy Yaoji, before there have been several villages suffered, because there is no upper fairy to help, those people have passed away.
（嗯？如此大范围的祸事，应该早就有修士来了才对，就算……）=(Hmm? Such a widespread scourge, there should have been cultivators coming long ago, even if ......)
谷老保重，接下来我该动身前往与瑶姬道友会合了。唔，我想想……「混沌地宫」应该位于摇光林入口的东北深处……=Gu Lao take care, next I should move to rendezvous with Daoist friend Yao Ji. Well, let's see ...... "Chaos Earth Palace" should be located deep in the northeast of the entrance to the Shaking Light Forest ......
等等，这是老朽一点心意，希望上仙不要推辞。=Wait, this is a little bit of my heart, I hope the immortal will not resist.
瑶姬被面具人的法宝打中，从空中摔落在地人事不省——=Yao Ji was hit by the masked man's magic weapon, fell from the air to the ground unconscious -
炎帝的掌上明珠，要风得风，要雨得雨。=The pearl of the palm of the Emperor, to wind to wind, to rain to rain.
安静当一个养尊处优的公主不好吗？偏偏来碍我的事。=Quietly being a pampered princess is not good? You have to come in my way.
我虽然不想得罪神农氏族，但是没有办法，你只能死在这里了。=Although I do not want to offend the Shennong clan, but there is no way, you can only die here.
瑶姬道友！！=Fellow Daoist Yogi!!!
嘿嘿嘿，你终于来了。=Hey hey hey, you're finally here.
你就是幕后之人？！=Are you the one behind the curtain?
多说无益，看招！=No point in talking, watch the move!
在漫天的斗法之中，男子的面具被劲气划过，飞落一旁，他露出真容——=In the midst of the roiling fight, the man's mask was sliced by the powerful air, flying aside, he revealed his true face -
不、不，不！我竟然会输？=No, no, no! I can't believe I'm losing?
不可能！！莫非，功法有假？！=Impossible!!! Could it be that there is a fake gong method?
你，你竟然就是面具人！=You, you are the masked man!
呵，像野狗一样死在路边，这就是我的结局吗……=Heh, dying like a wild dog on the side of the road, is this my end ......
我早该想到是你……哪有那么巧的事情……之前玄阴宗弟子之死本来你是针对我的吧？你没想到我走了另外一条上山小径。=I should have thought it was you ...... Which is such a coincidence ...... before the death of the Xuan Yin Sect disciples originally you are against me, right? You did not expect me to take another path up the mountain.
哼！不错！=Ha! Not bad!
可是，为什么？！=But, why?
纵使幸而得觅仙缘，也是受尽同门冷眼与刁难，什么名门正派，呵……=Even if you are lucky enough to find an immortal destiny, you are also subject to the cold eyes and difficulties of fellow disciples, what famous sect, he ......
都是一群戴着伪善面具的小人罢了，哈哈哈，可怜李元罡那个傻子，落入我设计的局中……他那师傅回光返照，功力大增原来是白仙人魔功的效果！=It's just a bunch of villains wearing hypocritical masks, hahaha, poor Li Yuan Gang that fool, fell into the bureau I designed ...... his master back to light, the power of the original is the effect of the White Immortal's magic power!
于是我挑唆他对门下弟子下手，趁机联合他的弟子夺了魔功，这些天元弟子也是蠢如鹿豕，反手就被我以魔功吸干了功力，哈哈。=So I instigated him to the disciples under the door, taking the opportunity to unite his disciples took the magic power, these Tian Yuan disciples are also stupid as deer boar, backhandedly by me to the magic power sucked dry power, ha ha.
（原来当年天元血案的元凶是道玄子，李元罡只是被嫁祸……）=(It turns out that the original culprit of the Tian Yuan bloodbath was Dao Xuanzi, Li Yuan Gang was only framed ......)
可拼命往上爬终于得了那掌门之位，最后发现只不过是给自己套上了另一副枷锁。=But the desperate climb up finally got the position of the head of the sect, and finally found that it is just another set of shackles to themselves.
世家、氏族自然有享之不尽的仙丹妙药，助他们得成大道。=The families and clans naturally have an endless supply of immortal Dans to help them attain the Great Way.
咳、我早就狠心点把你杀了，把危险扼杀在萌芽之中……我，我也曾想过归隐山林、皓首穷经……=Ahem, I have long been ruthless point to kill you, to nip the danger in the bud ...... me, I have also thought of retired to the mountains, the old head ......
过了许久，瑶姬幽幽醒转过来，你将事情经过讲述了一遍——=After a long time, Yaoji sorrowfully woke up, you will tell what happened -
可恶！亏我还以为道掌门是位德高望重的老前辈！没想到他狡诈如斯……=Damn! I thought Master Dao was a highly respected senior! I didn't expect him to be as cunning as this ......
自有长生之法以来，修士不知凡几，多如过江之鲫。=Since there is the law of immortality, cultivators are unknown, as many as the carp of the river.
可真正得道的又有几人呢？这条路的艰难之处不但在于修士需日日枯坐，静看寿元流逝……=But how many people have really achieved the path? The difficult part of this path is not only that the practitioner needs to sit quietly day after day and watch the life span pass ......
而在于在长生的诱惑面前有多少人可以遵循本心……仙凡的力量悬殊使得公平荡然无存，而凡人连最起码的生存权利都无法保障。=And how many people can follow their hearts in front of the lure of eternal life ...... The power disparity between immortal and mortal makes fairness non-existent, while mortals can't even guarantee the minimum right to live.
哎，师傅，我越来越觉得遁世苦修不是一条正确的路……这个世界不应该是这样的。=Hey, master, I increasingly feel that recluse asceticism is not a correct path ...... this world should not be so.
可人们常说：仙凡有别，不是吗？=But people always say: there is a difference between immortals and mortals, isn't it?
仙凡确实有别，但并不意味着需要完全摒弃人性，可现如今往往是他们对人性中的邪恶欲望全盘接受，慈悲之心一点不留。=Immortals and mortals do differ, but it does not mean that they need to completely abandon human nature, but nowadays they often accept the evil desires of human nature in its entirety, and compassion does not remain.
目光一转，你发现瑶姬正目光灼灼地看着你——=Eyes turn, you find Yogi is looking at you with burning eyes -
（此人有此心境，莫非他就是爹爹让我寻找的仙缘？）=(This person has this state of mind, could it be that he is the immortal destiny that father asked me to look for?)
瑶姬离开后，去了一趟阳谷村将村民相继救醒，而你修书数封发往云梦各派，将道玄子的恶行公之于众，也还了剑魔李元罡一个清白……=Yao Ji left, went to a trip to Yanggu village will be the villagers wake up one after another, and you repair several letters sent to the various factions of the cloud dream, the Tao Xuanzi's evil deeds to the public, but also returned the sword demon Li Yuan Gang a clean slate ......
无空山阴影=Shadow of the Empty Mountain
最近村中总是传来村民失踪的消息，虽然派人调查过此事，但都无功而返，老朽是一头雾水啊！还请上仙帮帮忙。=Recently the village has always come to the news of the villagers missing, although sent people to investigate the matter, but all to no avail, the old man is confused ah! Please help the immortals.
哎，也不是！一开始是两个浣洗妇失踪，我们都以为她们是被在无空山作乱的强盗给掳了去。=Hey, not really! At first, the two washerwomen disappeared, and we all thought they were taken away by the bandits who were running amok in the Khongless Mountain.
谁知这件事情发展得越来越诡异，后面三五天就会有一个人失踪！而且都是没有出嫁的黄花大闺女。=Who knows this thing is developing more and more bizarre, behind three or five days there will be a person missing! And they were all unmarried yellow girls.
什么？！这些人都是女子？=What?! These people are all women?
女、女子？噢对，上仙，这里面难道有什么缘故吗？=Female, female? Oh yes, the upper fairy, is there a reason for this?
（有些邪功在修炼时需要各种「鼎炉」，谷老所言便与此种情况相似，此事明显有修士参与……）=(Some evil kung fu in the cultivation of various "furnace", Gu Lao said it is similar to such a situation, the matter is clearly a monk involved ......)
我已经查明，此事乃一邪恶修士所为。=I have found out that this matter is the work of an evil monk.
好，好啊，上仙的大恩无以回报……这是我们村的一点心意。=Well, well, there is no way to repay the great kindness of the upper fairy ...... This is a little token of our village's appreciation.
上仙，无空山之事有眉目了吗？=Immortal, is there any news on the matter of Mount WuKong?
好浓烈的阴气。=What a strong Yin energy.
山中一祭坛被高高立起，骸骨堆积如山，一截白骨深深插入泥中，上面还有一个满是泥污的手镯——=An altar was erected high in the mountain, skeletons piled up like a mountain, a white bone deep into the mud, and a bracelet full of mud stains on top -
哈哈哈……既然被你发现了，那就留你不得！=Hahahaha ...... Since you found out, it is not possible to stay you!
大仇未报……我怎么可以倒下。=How can I fall down before the great revenge .......
李、元、罡，我恨。=Li, Yuan and Gang, I hate.
修士有呼风唤雨之力，如果一旦使用者失控，那普通人将面临灭顶之灾啊。=Monks have the power to call the wind and rain, if once the user is out of control, that ordinary people will face the end of the disaster ah.
哎，可怜无空山边骨，犹是春闺梦里人。=Hey, poor empty mountainside bones, is still the spring boudoir dreamers.
