<color\=#B21717>（惊醒）</color>师傅！！=<color\=#B21717>(Wakes up)</color> <size\=30>Master!!</size>
什……什么？！我这是，刚才我不是正在入定中吗？我睡着了？=What ... what?! I was, wasn't I just in the middle of meditation? Did I fall asleep?
（你从睡梦中悠悠醒转过来，右手下意识抚上了案上的古玉，这是你师傅的遗物，上面布满古朴的花纹和淡淡的“红印”。）=<size\=20>(Waking up from your sleep, your right hand subconsciously touched the Ancient Jade on the nightstand. Your Master's relic with ancient patterns and a faint "<color\=#B21717>Red Seal</color>")</size>
原来只是梦吗……哎，师傅，您老人家究竟去哪了……我这些年可是有好好遵从您的嘱托，隐世修炼，不沾凡尘因果……=<size\=20>So it was only a dream? ... Hey, Master, Old man, where'd you go ... I have followed your instructions well over the years, secluded cultivation, no involvement with mortal karma...</size>
但这么多年修为始终原地踏步……为何会如此，难道我……理解错了您所说的「出世之道」……=<size\=20>But for so many years the cultivation has always remained stagnant ... Why is this so, did I ... misunderstand what you said about "<color\=#FFFFFF>The Way Out</color>" ...</size>
<color\=#B21717>（摇头）</color>罢了，多想无益。=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Shakes head)</color></size>It's useless to think more about it.

师、掌门师尊，不好啦……=<size\=20>Master</size>, <size\=20>Master</size>, Master, there is bad news...
何事如此慌张？！=Why are you flustered?!
山门外来了一个满嘴胡话的疯老头想要见掌门师尊，怎么赶都赶不走……=Outside the mountain gate, there's a Crazy Old Man who wants to see Master. We were going to turn them away...
清风师兄上前驱赶，可此人身法诡异无比，每次都只能堪堪摸到对方的衣角……还，还狠狠地摔了一跤。=<size\=18>Senior Brother Qingfeng stepped forward to turn him away, but this person was very strange. Senior Brother could only touch the corners of the other party's clothes every time... and was defeated severely.</size>
竟有此事？且让出去会会他。=How could this happen? Let's go out and meet him.
疯老头=Crazy Old Man
嘿、嘿嘿嘿……嘿嘿。=He, he, he, he ... he, he.
<color\=#B21717>（大笑）</color>哈哈哈，你是五？还是六？！=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Laughing loudly)</color></size><size\=30>Hahaha</size>, are you five?\nOr six?
这位前辈是不是在山中迷路？我可命门下弟子送前辈下山。=Did this senior get lost in the mountains? I can order my disciples to guide senior down the mountain.

<color\=#B21717>（大哭）</color>天地寂灭，万物归虚……玉、玉佩！呜……呜呜。=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Crying loudly)</color></size>The heavens and the earth are silent, all things return ... Jade, Jade Pendant!\n<size\=18>Boohoo ... Boohoo</size>.
老者伸出微微颤抖的手，指向你腰际的玉佩——=The old man extends a slightly trembling hand and points to the Jade pendant at your waist -
前辈认得这玉佩？！=Senior recognizes this Jade pendant?
<color\=#B21717>（大笑）</color>离开……寻找……你我都不过是棋子罢了！哈哈哈哈……=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Laughing loudly)</color></size>Leave ... Seek ... You and I are just a chess pieces!\n<size\=30>Hahahaha...</size>
（疯老头在嬉笑之间化作一缕青烟消失不见，一张泛黄的纸飘入你的手中……）=(The Crazy Old Man disappears into a wisp of smoke between laughs, a yellowed paper floats into your hands ...)
<color\=#B21717>（惊讶）</color>好高深的遁法……咦？这纸上所绘的图案似乎在哪里见过。=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Amazed)</color></size>What a profund movement technique ... eh?\nThe pattern drawn on this paper, I seem to have been seen before.
此人虽行事疯癫、言辞不清，但他似乎认得师傅的玉佩？且他所说的「天星叩门」也令人在意……=<size\=20>Although this person acts crazy, slurred speech, he seems to recognize Master's Jade pendant? And what he said "<color\=#FFFFFF>The heavenly star knocking at the door</color>" is also interesting ...</size>
那是在云梦大地上从未见过的星夜奇象，而且它就发生在昨天夜里，这真是吉凶难测啊……=That is in the <color\=#9F2B68>cloud dream</color> region never seen the star night strange phenomenon, and it happened just last night, this is really lucky and unpredictable ah ...
唔，看来有必要下山去寻找一下线索，先去南边的柴桑村看看吧。=Well, it seems necessary to go down the mountain to look for clues; First, to the south the village of <color\=#088F8F>Chaisang</color> to see it.

无赖修士=Rogue Monk
嘿嘿，小娘子，看你面生，刚出师门历练吧？你跟着哥哥，哥哥保证你这次大获而归！=Hey, little lady, look at you, you've just left your master's training, right? Follow this brother and brother will ensure that you will reap great rewards!
神秘女子=<size\=18>Mysterious Woman</size>
<color\=#B21717>（皱眉）</color>如果你还想要你的手，我奉劝你把手拿回去。=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Frowns)</color></size>If you wish to keep your hand, I advise you to remove your hand.
哟？还是一匹野马？哥哥我就喜欢你这样的！=Oh? Like a wild horse? I like you just like that!
住手，你们在做什么！=Stop, what are you doing!
哈？你又是什么人？！敢管我的闲事！知道我谁吗？=Huh? Who are you again? How dare you meddle in my business! Do you know who I am?
柳一心=Yixin Liu
我就是“飞天神剑”柳一心！识相的赶紧滚！=I am the "Flying Sword" Liu Yixin! Get lost if you know what's good for you!
我偏要趟一回这浑水！（论道）=I have to go through this mess! (Discourse)
我确实不该多管闲事。（离开）=I really shouldn't meddle. (Leave)

###Discourse Route
你这次踢到铁板了！=You've kicked the bucket this time!
##A battle
你年纪轻轻便如此飞扬跋扈，你家师长就应该好好地管教管教你！你家师长何在？！=You are so domineering at such a young age, your teacher should have taught you a lesson! Where is your teacher?
<color\=#B21717>（双眼赤红）</color>你……你，你给我记住了！=<size\=20><color\=#B21717>(Eyes Red)</color></size>You ... you, I will remember you!
瑶姬=Ji Yao
我乃瑶姬，刚才谢过道友出手解围，我们有缘再见吧。=I am Yao Ji, just thank you for your help solving this problem, fate will let us meet again.
女子微微行礼然后化作一道虹光飞向了天边。=The woman saluted slightly then turned into a rainbow light and flew to the sky.
这个女子倒是面生得很，这个装束在云梦并不常见呢……不过现在还是处理正事要紧。=This woman seems familiar, this attire is not common around Yun Meng ... but it's better to take care of previous business currently.
##Relation goes Up with Ji Yao
此处便是柴桑村……我们不妨先找个人打听打听，咦……=This is the village of Chai Sang ... we might as well find someone to ask around first, eh ...
前面那位似乎也是一名修士，就先问问他吧。=The one in front seems to be a cultivator too, so let's ask him first.

##...... text
（现如今已到了柴桑村，不宜节外生枝，还是处理正事要紧。咦……）=(Now that we have arrived at Chai Sang Village, it is advisable not to cause a trouble outside, oand more important to deal with business. Huh ...)
（前面那位好像是一名修士，不妨先向他打听打听。）=(The one in front seems to be a cultivator too, might as well ask him first.)

####Both Routes
黄木=Mu Huang
「天星叩门」的线索（任务）=The clues on "The Star of Heaven Knocks" (Mission)
这位道友有礼了，我想跟你打听一下有关「天星叩门」的消息……=This daoist friend is polite, I wish to inquire some information on "The Star of Heaven Knocks" ...
「天星叩门」不就是那……什么……哎！道友你想知道「天星叩门」？这可不就巧了！=Isn't that the "The Star of Heaven Knocks" ... what? ... oops! You wish to know about the "Heavenly Star Knocking at the Door"? What a coincidence!
嘿嘿，实不相瞒，我确实知道一些消息，只不过嘛，这消息我来之不易……=Hey, I'm not going to lie, I do know some information, but well, this information was not easy to come by ...
我曾听闻此地东北方的九嶷山谷有一只长牙孽畜叫“金睛兽”，此獠一身都是宝，尤其是它的精血可入药炼丹，乃修炼至宝……=<size\=18>I have heard that there is a long-toothed beast called "Golden-Eyed Beast" in Jiuyi Mountain Valley to the northeast of this place, this beast is a treasure, especially its blood can be used in medicine to make Dans, which is most important for cultivation ...</size>
如果你能为我寻来金睛兽精血，我就告诉你如何？=If you can acquire the Golden-Eyed Beast blood for me, I will show you how to?
（金睛兽？！那可是妖兽鉴里记载的妖兽，实力之强横……）=(Golden-Eyed Beast? That is a demonic beast recorded in the demonic beast book, it shows tyrranical strength ...)
到时候还请道友遵守诺言。（接受任务）=When the time comes, please keep your promise. (Accept the mission)
我可不想白白葬送性命！（离开）=I don't want to die in vain! (Leave)
###Accept Mission Route
呵呵，很自信嘛。不过别怪我没有提醒你，此番起码需要五个修士联手才能将那孽畜拿下。=Oh, very confident. But don't blame me for not reminding you, this time at least five cultivators need to join forces to take down that sinful beast.
假如以你现在的实力就贸然前去找寻，怕是只会变成那金睛兽的盘中餐。=Looking for it at your current strength rashly, I'm afraid you will only become the Golden-Eyed Beast's next meal.
（他说得不错，此事得从长计议，我不妨先招收弟子、提升实力，做好万全准备再前往。）=(He is right, this matter has to be considered in the long run, I might as well recruit disciples, improve my strength and make all preperations before going.)
（正好最近有求道者来我派寻求仙缘，先回门派看一看求道者名单上有没有好苗子。）=<size\=20>(It just so happens that recently there are seekers coming to our sect seeking immortal destiny, so first go back to the sect to see if there are any good seedlings on the list of seekers.)</size>
###Leave Route
好吧，等你想做了再来找我吧，不过没有金睛兽精血我是不会说那个消息的。=Well, come back to me when you want to do it, but I won't give any information without the Golden-Eyed Beast Blood.

###Upon Returning to Sect Mountain after achieving Discourse Route

高，高人！您，您收下我吧！收我为徒！呜……=Venerable, Venerable one! You, you take me in! Take me as a disciple! Woo ...
##......? text
我知道您此时一定理不清头绪，请您听我说……=I know you must be confused at this moment, please listen to me ...
我自幼失孤，被叔叔带入修炼之门，但叔叔也英年早逝，从此我便流浪云梦，仗着会些法术就召集狐朋狗友胡作非为……=<size\=18>I have been orphaned since childhood, was brought into the door of cultivation by my Uncle, but my Uncle also died young, since then I wondered <color\=#9F2B68>cloud dream</color> region, relying on basic Techniques and surrounding myself with mischevious friends  ...</size>
自上次被您惩戒教训后，我想起了叔叔对我的教诲，惭愧不已！我想明白了，我缺少的正是像您这样正直的严师！=Since the last time I was disciplined by you, I remembered what my uncle had taught me and was ashamed! I figured out that what I lacked was a stern and upright teacher like you!
我愿收你为徒（收为徒弟）=I will take you in as a disciple (Take as Disciple)
你与我无缘（驱赶离开）=You have no business with me (Drive Away)

####Take as Disciple Route
好，知错能改，善莫大焉，以后你就是我门中人了。=Well, if you know your mistakes can be corrected, there is nothing better, you will be one of us from now on.
眼前年轻的男子欣喜若狂，跪下磕了三个响头。=The young man in front was ecstatic and knelt down and kowtowed three times.

####Drive Away Route
##...... text
男子脸上流露出落寞的神情，失魂落魄地离开了这里，只留下一个萧瑟的背影——=A despondent look passed over the man's face, and he left the place lost in thought, leaving only a sullen back -
